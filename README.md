# Godot Collaborative Game Jam re-usable components

Each component in `/src/components/` comes with a *README.md* and a *component_credits.txt*.

Some have asset dependencies that are located in `src/assets/components/`

# List of components

- **Credits Parser**: parses credit files generated/provided by us and displays them in your Godot Game
- **Discord Link**: a TextureButton with our logo that opens an invite URL to our Discord Server
- **Stamp Splash Screen**: A custom splash screen animation we used in Spiritkeeper
